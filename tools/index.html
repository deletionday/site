<h1>Tools for deletion</h1>

<main>
<p class="intro">Below is a list of tools and resources that may help with auditing and deletion. Though we do our best to keep this list updated, the data industry has strong incentives to break any tool promoting deletion. If you think something is outdated or missing from this list, please <a href="https://github.com/deletionday/site" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contribute here</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="data-brokers">Data brokers</h2>
	<p>The following lists contain dozens of companies who make money by aggregating data about you. Be prepared: some of these companies know your address or phone number. Some opt-outs will be relatively frictionless, but many are difficult by design. We hope the following resources will help, especially with companies that try to obscure their legal obligation to fulfill deletion requests.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ElB7VXmr5JEkFaLJpO7YLGrAuasedmq-rZC-8TUMxTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Ass Data Broker Opt-Out List</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.stopdatamining.me/opt-out-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StopDataMining.me’s Opt-Out List</a></li>
		<li>Motherboard's <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ne9b3z/how-to-get-off-data-broker-and-people-search-sites-pipl-spokeo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long List of Data Broker Sites and How to Opt-Out of Them</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="doxing">Doxing</h2>
	<p>Sadly, it doesn’t take much to uncover the identity or even whereabouts of an average Internet user. Stalkers, harassers, online vigilantes, and bored assholes could decide to target anyone. <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/when-promoting-knowledge-makes-you-a-target" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Innocent people are doxed and harassed frequently</a> on the Internet.</p>
	<p>Part of being safe online is knowing the risks. “Reconnaissance” tools exist with the express purpose of tracking down individuals. They are free, easy to use, and widely available. With this knowledge, there are steps you can take to protect yourself. We’ve listed some guides below:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Slate Magazine: <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/02/how-and-why-dox-yourself.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why You Should Dox Yourself (Sort Of)</a></li>
		<li>The Online Harassment Field Manual’s <a href="https://onlineharassmentfieldmanual.pen.org/protecting-information-from-doxing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protecting Information from Doxing</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="social-media">Social media</h2>
	<p class="disclaimer">Precious memories can exist within online spaces. Below are suggestions for how to reclaim your content from corporate ownership, but we recognize the importance and sentimentality of such data. All of these sites have <strong>export</strong> or <strong>backup</strong> features which let you download your data to a private hard drive before deleting them. You may wish to investigate these options before proceeding.</p>
	<h3 id="facebook">Facebook</h3>
	<p>Great news: after enough public outcry and <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/investigations/investigations-into-businesses/2009/pipeda-2009-008/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over a decade of legal pressure</a>, Facebook now has an official help article titled “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/250563911970368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How do I permanently delete my Facebook account?</a>”. This should be all you need if you want to completely delete your profile.</p>
	<p>If you want to keep your Facebook account but remove content you’ve uploaded, it’s a more involved process. Facebook doesn’t offer official tools for bulk deletion. But it’s still possible – here are some links to get you started:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The quickest way to delete photos you’ve uploaded is by deleting full albums. You’ll still need to delete your profile pictures and cover photos one-by-one.</li>
		<li>If you or a friend knows how to program, several open-source projects exist to help delete (or “scrub”, “clear”, “wipe”) your post history. A quick search should find a project relevant to your skills and needs, but here’s a recently updated <a href="https://github.com/weskerfoot/DeleteFB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python utility</a>.</li>
		<li>You can view, audit, and remove apps and websites you've used Facebook to log into from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications&ref=settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the settings page</a>. These can have privileged access to your data and are worth limiting.</li>
		<li>More bulk tools are detailed in “<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-quickly-delete-old-facebook-posts">How to Quickly Delete Old Facebook Posts</a>”. <strong>We have not performed a security audit on any third-party deletion tools, and thus cannot endorse them.</strong></li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="instagram">Instagram</h3>
	<p>Similar to its parent company Facebook, Instagram provides <a href="https://help.instagram.com/370452623149242" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clear instructions for fully deleting your account</a>. However, if you want to delete the photos from your account but keep your username or followers, there is no official supported solution.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Depending on how many photos you’ve posted, your quickest option might be manually deleting photos one-by-one.</li>
		<li>You can also rely on third-party apps, as detailed in <a href="https://www.techjunkie.com/delete-all-instagram-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article</a>. <strong>We have not performed a security audit on any third-party deletion tools, and thus cannot endorse them.</strong> Please make up your own mind about these tools.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you’re in a bind, we suggest you restrict your privacy settings and explore another option before giving your login details to closed-source third-party tools.</p>

	<h3 id="reddit">Reddit</h3>
	<p>Because Reddit is public by default, plenty of free archive and analysis tools such as <a href="https://snoopsnoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snoop Snoo</a> and <a href="https://www.removeddit.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Removeddit</a> exist. With these tools, it’s surprisingly easy to discover a user’s identity.</p>
	<p>To deactivate your account, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_delete_my_account.3F">here is an FAQ entry</a>. <strong>Your comment and post history will remain,</strong> but your username will be replaced by the string <code>[deleted]</code>.</p>
	<p>We recommend obscuring or deleting prior posting history before deleting your account. We have had success using the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/j0be/PowerDeleteSuite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Power Delete Suite</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/x89/Shreddit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shreddit</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/10380-reddit-overwrite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit overwrite script</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="twitter">Twitter</h3>
	<p>The quickest way to permanently remove a Twitter account is to <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-deactivate-twitter-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deactivate it</a>.</p>
	<p>If you want to delete your tweets or likes without deactivating your account, these options may help:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you or a friend knows how to program, Twitter has an API that permits deletion. There are great libraries for accessing the API from many common programming languages. For example, here is a <a href="https://gist.github.com/robinsloan/3688616" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruby script to delete tweets beyond a certain age</a>, and a <a href="https://gist.github.com/robinsloan/5cbb76d9f8ab7ec15b5c811dd671959a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matching script for Twitter likes</a>.</li>
		<li>If you don’t want to program a solution, there are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16991396/how-to-delete-twitter-history-tweetdelete" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third-party options for timeline deletion</a>. <strong>We have not performed a security audit on any third-party deletion tools, and thus cannot endorse them.</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<p>By default, Twitter stores <em>and publishes</em> location data alongside your tweets. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/location" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turn it off here</a>. There is an option to delete all location information you’ve uploaded in the past.</p>

	<h2 id="misc">Miscellaneous</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://justdeleteme.xyz/" target="_blank" ref="noopener noreferrer">Just Delete Me</a>, a directory of direct links to delete your account from web services.</li>
		<li><a href="https://privacyspy.org" target="_blank" ref="noopener noreferrer">PrivacySpy</a>, an open project to rate, annotate, and archive privacy policies.</li>
